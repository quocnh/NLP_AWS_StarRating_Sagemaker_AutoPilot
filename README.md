### Introduction to the App: 
NLP Text Processing and Star Rating Analysis with Amazon Customer Reviews using AutoML (SageMaker AutoPilot)
This application leverages the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot to analyze customer reviews and predict star ratings. By processing textual data from Amazon customer reviews, the app transforms raw feedback into actionable insights, offering an automated and scalable solution for sentiment analysis and review classification.

### Key Features:
- Text Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares raw review data by removing noise, tokenizing text, and handling missing or invalid entries.
- NLP Pipeline: Applies advanced techniques such as word embeddings, TF-IDF, or bag-of-words to transform text into machine-readable formats.
- AutoML with SageMaker AutoPilot: Automatically builds, trains, and tunes machine learning models, selecting the best algorithm for predicting customer review star ratings.
- Scalable Predictions: Easily handles large datasets using the robust infrastructure of AWS SageMaker.
- User-Friendly Insights: Generates insights into customer sentiment and product performance, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

### Use Case:
### **Input**

The input to the application is the **Amazon customer reviews dataset**, specifically `amazon_reviews_us_Digital_Software_v1_00.tsv.zip`. The dataset contains various columns, but the application focuses on processing the following key fields:

1. **Input Features**:
   - **`review_body`**: The text of the customer review, which is the primary input for NLP analysis.
   - **`review_title`** (optional): Title of the review, which can provide additional context.
   - **Other Preprocessing**: Any necessary data cleaning, such as removing null values or invalid entries, is applied.

2. **Auxiliary Fields** (optional for metadata analysis):
   - **`product_id`**: The identifier for the product.
   - **`customer_id`**: The identifier for the reviewer.
   - **`helpful_votes`**: Indicates whether the review was marked as helpful.
   - **`verified_purchase`**: Boolean indicating whether the purchase was verified.

---

### **Output**

The output of the application consists of predictions and insights generated by the trained model:

1. **Primary Output**:
   - **`star_rating`**: The predicted star rating for each review (e.g., 1â€“5 stars).
     - Example: A review body like "Great software, easy to use!" might predict a `star_rating` of **5**.
   - **Prediction Confidence**: The model's confidence level for the predicted star rating.

2. **Secondary Outputs**:
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorization of reviews as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** based on the text sentiment.
   - **Insights/Reports**: Aggregated analysis of review trends (e.g., average star rating, percentage of positive vs. negative reviews).

3. **Data Visualization** (Optional):
   - Graphs and charts showing distributions of star ratings, word cloud for commonly used terms, or trends in customer sentiment over time.

### **Example Mapping**

**Input** (From the Dataset):

| `review_body`                           | `review_title`    | `star_rating` |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| "The software is amazing and easy to use!" | "Great Product"    | **5**         |
| "Terrible, crashes all the time."       | "Disappointed"    | **1**         |

**Output**:

| `review_body`                           | Predicted `star_rating` | Sentiment  |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| "The software is amazing and easy to use!" | **5**                   | Positive   |
| "Terrible, crashes all the time."       | **1**                   | Negative   |
